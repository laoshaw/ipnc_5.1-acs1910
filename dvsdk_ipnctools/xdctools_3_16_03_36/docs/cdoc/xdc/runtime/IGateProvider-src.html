</span>    23    <span class="xdoc"> *  ======== IGateProvider ========
</span>    24    <span class="xdoc"> *  Interface implemented by all gate providers
</span>    25    <span class="xdoc"> *
</span>    26    <span class="xdoc"> *  Gates are used within the `xdc.runtime` package to serialize access
</span>    27    <span class="xdoc"> *  to data structures that are used by more than one thread.
</span>    28    <span class="xdoc"> *
</span>    29    <span class="xdoc"> *  Gates are responsible for ensuring that only one out of multiple threads
</span>    30    <span class="xdoc"> *  can access a data structure at a time.  There
</span>    31    <span class="xdoc"> *  are important scheduling latency and performance considerations that
</span>    32    <span class="xdoc"> *  affect the "type" of gate used to protect each data structure.  For
</span>    33    <span class="xdoc"> *  example, the best way to protect a shared counter is to simply disable
</span>    34    <span class="xdoc"> *  all interrupts before the update and restore the interrupt state after
</span>    35    <span class="xdoc"> *  the update; disabling all interrupts prevents all thread switching, so
</span>    36    <span class="xdoc"> *  the update is guaranteed to be "atomic".  Although highly efficient, this
</span>    37    <span class="xdoc"> *  method of creating atomic sections causes serious system latencies when
</span>    38    <span class="xdoc"> *  the time required to update the data structure can't be bounded.
</span>    39    <span class="xdoc"> *
</span>    40    <span class="xdoc"> *  For example, a memory manager's list of free blocks can grow indefinitely
</span>    41    <span class="xdoc"> *  long during periods of high fragmentation.  Searching such a list with
</span>    42    <span class="xdoc"> *  interrupts disabled would cause system latencies to also become unbounded.
</span>    43    <span class="xdoc"> *  In this case, the best solution is to provide a gate that suspends the
</span>    44    <span class="xdoc"> *  execution of  threads that try to enter a gate that has already been
</span>    45    <span class="xdoc"> *  entered; i.e., the gate "blocks" the thread until the thread
</span>    46    <span class="xdoc"> *  already in the gate leaves.  The time required to enter and leave the
</span>    47    <span class="xdoc"> *  gate is greater than simply enabling and restoring interrupts, but since
</span>    48    <span class="xdoc"> *  the time spent within the gate is relatively large, the overhead caused by 
</span>    49    <span class="xdoc"> *  entering and leaving gates will not become a significant percentage of
</span>    50    <span class="xdoc"> *  overall system time.  More importantly, threads that do not need to 
</span>    51    <span class="xdoc"> *  access the shared data structure are completely unaffected by threads
</span>    52    <span class="xdoc"> *  that do access it.
</span>    53    <span class="xdoc"> *
</span>    54    <span class="xdoc"> *  <b>@a(Notes)</b>
</span>    55    <span class="xdoc"> *  Modules inheriting this interface should treat all names beginning with
</span>    56    <span class="xdoc"> *  `Q_` as reserved words, i.e. the names from that namespace should not
</span>    57    <span class="xdoc"> *  be used.  This will allow future version of this interface to define new
</span>    58    <span class="xdoc"> *  constants ("qualities" ) similar to `{<b>@link</b> #Q_BLOCKING}` and
